      <h2>The Unforgettable Smile</h2>
      <p>
        The subject's expression is perhaps the most defining feature of the painting, often debated by art critics and historians. Some interpret it as a subtle smirk, while others see a deep and knowing gaze. The smile appears most prominent when viewed peripherally rather than directly, creating an ever-changing, elusive quality.
      
          Leonardo employed <strong>sfumato</strong>, a technique that creates soft transitions between colors and tones, giving the painting its lifelike appearance. This technique involves the layering of thin coats of paint to create a hazy, smoke-like effect (the word "sfumato" comes from the Italian word for smoke). The detailed textures and balanced composition highlight the artist's unmatched skill.
